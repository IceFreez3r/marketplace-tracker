# Marketplace Tracker
**An [Idlescape](https://idlescape.com) extension**

Automatically tracks the marketprices for Idlescape using the [market API](https://idlescape.com/api/market/manifest). Prices are analyzed and displayed at various places in the game.

## Installation Options

Install the [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/idlescape-marketplace-tracker/) from Mozillas Addon Store or

Install Tampermonkey for your browser ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)) and then install the [Userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceFreez3r/marketplace-tracker/main/marketplace_tracker.user.js).

Please visit the marketplace once afterwards to initialize the extension.

## Features

### Marketplace
Adds the option to mark items as favorite, which highlights them in the market overview and lets you filter for them with a single button click. Furthermore the heat item that had the best gold/heat ratio in the last API call is also highlighted in the overview.

On the buy tab low cost items are highlighted in relation to the maximum price in the collected data:
- <95% of maximum price &rarr; red ðŸ”´
- <80% of maximum price &rarr; yellow ðŸŸ¡
- <60% of maximum price &rarr; green ðŸŸ¢

There is also a popup when hovering entries, which shows you the theoretical profit if you would buy the entire stack and resell for max price. This is already on the [todo list](#planned-features) to be reworked.

### Crafting
Shows the cost for buying all ingredients for a recipe compared to the cost of buying the crafted item directly.

We decided against a profit column here, since most of the recipes aren't profitable.

### Enchanting
Shows the cost for buying all ingredients for crafting a scroll compared to the cost of buying the scroll directly. The crafting costs also include the chance of success. Additionally there is a profit column, which already includes the 5% market fee.

### Smithing
Same thing once again. The last column is the profit, which includes the 5% market fee.

### Farming
Sorts the seeds based on their type into categories:
- Mysterious Seeds
- Single Slot Seeds
- Multi Slot Seeds

If you don't have a seed type an empty box with a faded image is added, resulting in a grid, that has always the same size. Seeds, that require a higher farming level than you have, have a darker image (not shown in the screenshot).

### Offline Summary
Adds up the value of all the items you acquired while offline and displays total and per hour information.

Note that the per hour information is only accurate if you are offline for a longer time and will always only be an estimate.

The Offline tracker also works with the Resource Tracker from [ISscripts](https://github.com/daelidle/ISscripts).

### Other

Note that API prices are always at least 10 minutes outdated due to how the API works. The extension doesn't sync it's API requests with the updates of the API, meaning longer times are possible.

When ever the minimum or maximum price is shown, it is actually the 5%/95% quantile of the collected data. This step is done to reduce the impact of outliers. Otherwise a direct player trade with a price of only 1 gold, that manages to get into the API data, would make all computations pretty useless.

The data is stored on your computer in the `localStorage` of the browser. There is no exchange of data with any server.

To make sure, that the data of the extension isn't outdated, every API call is only stored for two weeks.
